## Experiments with Steering Behaviours in Processing

See an exemple of a ["Tag Game" live](http://popox.github.io/TagDemo).

### Overview

This coursework was done in pair. It will got us to implement and experiment with
the steering behaviours that we saw in the lectures, using the Processing language and
development environment. We were required to implement four separate Processing programs
(or ‘sketches’) based on the example program provided. There were also three short experimental
investigations to perform. A concise write up of each experiment (method, results, conclusions)
ad to be included in a report. Using Processing requires some fairly basic Java programming.
